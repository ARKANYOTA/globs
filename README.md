Meet the size-changing Globs in this colorful and charming puzzle game. Shrink, grow, push, and move Globs to solve a variety of puzzles. Discover 24 levels across 4 different worlds. 

This game was made using the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org) in 96 hours for the [GMTK Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024) based on the theme "Built to Scale".

</h2>

Install [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) (preferably version v4.3, which is the version this was designed for).

Open the `src` folder in the Godot project manager.

To export, look at the [Godot documentation page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html) about exporting projects.

    </span> Is this game open source?
</h2>

**No.** In contrast to [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), this game is only [source available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software). **Not having a licence means that by default we reserve all original rights for the game, even if the code is public.**  

However, we want to be very lax with what you can do with the source code. This is just to cover our asses from people that reupload games without consent to other places. Please feel free to reuse bits of code or assets, or modify the source code for any non-commercial project, as long as you're not directly distributing the code, assets, or any executables. (More details below)  
<sub>*(This does not mean that we are giving up any rights, by the way; this is purely indicative.)*</sub>

If it does not fit that description please contact us at `ninesliced@gmail.com`. I don't bite! :)

### Examples of things that ARE okay:
- Reusing some sprites or small bits of code (functions, classes, Godot nodes...) in your games, even commercial, and crediting us.
- Forking this repo and making your own mods, as long as you are not profiting from them.
- Writing reviews, or sharing screenshots and videos online.
- Linking to the page of this repo or its official links.

### Examples of things that are NOT okay:
- Taking any pre-existing or self-built executables, with no or minor modifications, or a major part of the source code, and reuploading it to other places, whether you are directly or indirectly profiting from it or not.
- We just don't like what you are doing. (e.g., AI-powered NFT cryptocurrency trading cards)
