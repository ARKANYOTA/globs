[**Google Play**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yolwoocle.globs) · [**Steam**](https://s.team/a/3219110) · [**itch.io**](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/globs) · [**GitHub**](https://github.com/ARKANYOTA/gmtk2024/) · [**Releases**](https://github.com/ARKANYOTA/gmtk2024/releases)

Meet the size-changing Globs in this colorful puzzle game. Use the curious properties of their bodies at your advantage to solve a variety of puzzles, all in a expressive pixel art aesthetic and upbeat soundtrack.

This game was made using the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org), originally in 96 hours for the [GMTK Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024) based on the theme "Built to Scale", but we continued working on it afterwards.

    </span> Is this game open source?
</h2>

**No.** In contrast to [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), this game is only [source available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software). **Not having a licence means that by default we reserve all original rights for the game, even if the code is public.**  

However, we are very lax with what you can do with the source code. This is just to legally cover our asses from people that reupload games without our consent. 

### Examples of things that ARE okay:
- Reusing some sprites or small bits of code (functions, classes, Godot nodes...) in your games, even commercial, and crediting us.
- Forking this repo and making your own mods, as long as you are not profiting from them.
- Writing reviews, or sharing screenshots and videos online.
- Linking to the page of this repo or its official links.

<sub>*This does not mean that we are giving up any rights, by the way; this is purely indicative.*</sub>

### Examples of things that are NOT okay:
- Taking any pre-existing or self-built executables, with no or minor modifications, or a major part of the source code, and reuploading it to other places, whether you are directly or indirectly profiting from it or not.
- We just don't like what you are doing. (e.g., AI-powered NFT crypto trading cards)

    </span> Running, exporting, and contributing
</h2>

Install [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) (preferably version 4.3, which is the version this was designed for).  
Open the `src` folder in the Godot project manager.

To export, look at the [Godot documentation page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html) about exporting projects.  
**IMPORTANT**: For Android builds, when exporting, please select the export mode to "Export all resources in the project except resourced checked below", and disable `discord-rpc-gd` and `godotsteam`. (In general, the game is designed to work with any of the extensions disabled.)
